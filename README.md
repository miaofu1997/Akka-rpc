# Akka-rpc
Akka is the implementation of the **Actor** Model on the JVM, a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for Java and Scala. 

This project documents my first Akka hands-on experience, including Master and Woker, how they connect and send/receive messages from each other and how they react to it.
